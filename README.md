A fantastic way to pass your time while having some fun, Rapper Ad-Lib Quiz is a definite must have for the rap-loving bunch. As every dedicated rap fan knows, each rapper, no matter how big or small, has a signature ad-lib. This is their trademark noise, phrase, word or sound. Anyone who is a major rap fan can easily identify these and guess the rapper. 
In this quiz app, you’ll will hear a short ad-lib from a famous rapper for just 1-3 seconds. After that you’ll get the options to identify the rapper. Do it fast though because you’ll have a deadline!

__Note:__ For rap fans, Rapper Ad-Lib Quiz might be addictive due of its fun filled experience. Caution is advised during use.
